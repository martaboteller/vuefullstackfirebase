## About the project

I've followed this LinkedIn <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/learning/vue-js-full-stack-applications-with-firebase?contextUrn=urn%3Ali%3AlyndaLearningPath%3A5d94ce0a498e93731fbb8711">course</a> offered by Ray Villalobos.

Quickly assemble useful applications by combining the Vue.js front-end framework with the easily accessible power of the Firebase server engine from Google. This course shows how to create a working single-page app using the Vue.js framework layered on the Firebase cloud platform.
It includes features like user registration and authentication.

I am on my way to achieve a :rocket: fullstack overview!
